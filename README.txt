The whole project is about a front end website which consists of a math quiz. The quiz is made up of some basic math questions. Each individual question could be answered and the result could be checked using check button which is situated under every question. There is also a final check score button at the end. This button could also be used without using the check button in any of the individual questions. The title of website is “Check some Math Skills” and is made up of html, javascript and some css.
